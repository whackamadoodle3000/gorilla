Generally respect the BFCL evaluation but think about what you would want to tell the model in order for it to improve in the many cases it may face in the future.keep the playbook unchanged on successes unless an existing entry now conflicts with verified behaviour.

Return an empty list when no update is needed.\n\nReturn JSON with keys \"reasoning\" (<=2 sentences) and \"operations\".\nEach operation must be one of:\n  {\"type\": \"ADD\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"content\": \"<short bullet>\"}\n  {\"type\": \"MODIFY\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"ID\": \"<existing id>\", \"content\": \"<short bullet>\"}\n  {\"type\": \"REMOVE\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"ID\": \"<existing id>\"}"
