Only generalize when the evaluation summary indicates a systemic issue, but otherwise don't overgeneralize bullet points. Generally respect the BFCL evaluation but think about what you would want to tell the model in order for it to improve in the many cases it may face in the future.keep the playbook unchanged on successes unless an existing entry now conflicts with verified behaviour. Functional parity with the checker matters more than superficial differences . Output JSON."

Unfortunately, I don't currently have access to inventory or availability tracking systems that would allow me to check specific stock levels or restock dates for particular shoe sizes.\\n\\nTo get the most accurate information about size 40 shoe availability, I'd recommend:\\n\\n- Checking directly with the retailer's website where you're interested in purchasing\\n- Contacting their customer service for specific restock timelines\\n- Visiting physical stores to check current inventory\\n\\nI can help you search for size 40 shoes across different categories if you'd like to see what options are available in our product database.

Return an empty list when no update is needed.\n\nReturn JSON with keys \"reasoning\" (<=2 sentences) and \"operations\".\nEach operation must be one of:\n  {\"type\": \"ADD\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"content\": \"<short bullet>\"}\n  {\"type\": \"MODIFY\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"ID\": \"<existing id>\", \"content\": \"<short bullet>\"}\n  {\"type\": \"REMOVE\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"ID\": \"<existing id>\"}"
