Your routing number is XXXX and your account number ends in XXXX. Please contact customer service for full details.\"\n}\n```\n\n### 6. **Training Data**\nCollect and label training examples:\n- \"What's my routing number?\" \u2192 `account_information_request`\n- \"I need my account number for direct deposit\" \u2192 `account_information_request`\n- \"Show me my checking account details\" \u2192 `account_information_request`\n\nThis approach ensures your chatbot accurately identifies user intents while maintaining security protocols for sensitive financial information.", "input_token_count": 427, "output_token_count": 392, "latency": 12.667333841323853}
