{"id": "irrelevance_238", "result": "I can see you want to calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides 5 and 6. However, I don't currently have access to a mathematical calculation tool that can perform this specific type of calculation.\n\nFor a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: c = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), where a and b are the other two sides. In your case:\n\nc = \u221a(5\u00b2 + 6\u00b2) = \u221a(25 + 36) = \u221a61 \u2248 7.81\n\nYou could use a calculator or any basic math application to compute this. If you need to perform similar calculations regularly, I'd recommend using a calculator app or mathematical software.", "input_token_count": 435, "output_token_count": 148, "latency": 6.596691131591797}
