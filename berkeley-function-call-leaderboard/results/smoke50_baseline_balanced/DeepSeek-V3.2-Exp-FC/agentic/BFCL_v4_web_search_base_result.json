Despite successive renovations that had expanded its capacity to 25,000 seats, the stadium was still insufficient for the club's needs. Faced with this situation, in the spring of 1943, President\\nAntonio Santos Peralba\\nexpressed the need to build a new stadium with an initial capacity of 40,000 spectators,\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nalthough the club's financial difficulties raised uncertainties about its realization.\\nWith the arrival of\\nSantiago Bernab\\u00e9u\\nto the presidency in September 1943, the plan for the new stadium gained decisive and much more ambitious momentum. In his first meeting with the Board of Directors, Bernab\\u00e9u declared: \\\"\\nGentlemen, we need a bigger field and we are going to build it\\n\\\".\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nBernab\\u00e9u's vision was to build an even larger stadium than the one proposed by Peralba, with a capacity close to 75,000 spectators. Bernab\\u00e9u firmly believed that a larger stadium would allow the club to raise more money, which in turn would enable the club to grow, sign better players, and attract more fans, creating a virtuous cycle that would benefit the team in the long run.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\nOn 1 November 1943, the Board of Directors visited the land adjacent to the Campo de Chamart\\u00edn, located in the extension of the\\nPaseo de la Castellana\\n, to analyze its possible expansion. These lands belonged to the \\\"Villa Ulpiana\\\" estate and another known as \\\"Entrecanales\\\", owned by the Maqueda and Ch\\u00e1varri families. Shortly thereafter, negotiations began to acquire them for a total cost of 3,000,000 pesetas.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nOn 22 June 1944, the land acquisitions were formalized before a notary: 256,667 square feet for 2,000,000 pesetas from the Ruiz del Villar family and 93,877 square feet for 1,001,069 pesetas from the Maqueda and Ch\\u00e1varri families. Additionally, the necessary expropriations for the urbanization of the area, including the future streets Concha Espina and Plaza de los Sagrados Corazones, cost 1,000,000 pesetas.\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nTo choose the design for the new stadium, a Competition of Ideas and Sketches was organized, in which renowned architects participated. The architects\\nPedro Muguruza\\nand Javier Barroso, former goalkeepers of\\nAthletic de Madrid\\nand friends of Bernab\\u00e9u, were part of the jury along with board members Fernando de C\\u00e1rcer Disdier, first vice president, and Pedro M\\u00e9ndez Cuesta, board member responsible for the field and an architect by profession.\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn September 1944, after evaluating the seven submitted projects, the jury awarded the first prize to the design of Manuel Mu\\u00f1oz Monasterio and Luis Alemany Soler. The award-winning works were exhibited at the\\nC\\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes\\n, where they sparked great interest and debate among fans.\\nOn 27 October 1944, the land was blessed, and construction was symbolically initiated with a groundbreaking strike by Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\nThe financing of the construction presented significant challenges due to the distrust of members and banking entities. Despite the skepticism of many people, including some members and supporters, regarding the project's feasibility, Bernab\\u00e9u remained steadfast in his purpose. In a context where banks did not consider football a safe investment and where official support from sports organizations was not obtainable, Bernab\\u00e9u delegated to treasurer Luis Corrales Ferras\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nthe task of designing an innovative financing plan. This plan involved the issuance of bonds with mortgage guarantees on the club's properties.\\nThe next step was crucial:\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nBernab\\u00e9u presented this plan to Rafael Salgado, president of Banco Mercantil e Industrial and a Real Madrid supporter. Thanks to Bernab\\u00e9u's passionate and detailed explanation, Salgado agreed to finance the project, convinced of the viability and potential of the new stadium. This decision was crucial for the project's realization, and in recognition of his support, one of the streets adjacent to the stadium bears his name.\\nThe financing plan was structured into three staggered bond issues:\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nFirst issue\\nof 20,000 bonds for a total of 10,000,000 pesetas on 9 November 1944.\\nSecond issue\\nof 30,000 bonds for 15,000,000 pesetas on 18 March 1946.\\nThird issue\\nof 10,000 bonds totaling 5,000,000 pesetas on 8 October 1947.\\nAll the issues were covered on the day they were released to the Stock Market, thanks to the enthusiasm and confidence of the members, even the most modest ones. The plan was a complete success and allowed for staggered financing adjusted to the construction needs.\\nThe construction was awarded to the company Huarte y Compa\\u00f1\\u00eda, S.A.,\\n[\\n11\\n]\\n[\\n16\\n]\\nbeginning in June 1945 under the direction of architects Alemany and Mu\\u00f1oz Monasterio and with the collaboration of civil engineer Carlos Fern\\u00e1ndez Casado.\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nOver 30 months, the works faced numerous obstacles, from the shortage of basic materials in post-war Spain to technical difficulties due to a nearby railway link popularly known as the \\\"tunnel of laughter\\\". However, the project progressed with enthusiasm and dedication.\\nThe construction of the new field took place on the grounds of the old field and on the lands of Villa Ulpiana,\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nwhich could have disrupted the club's life. However, this only happened from 1946 when Real Madrid was forced to play home games at the\\nStadium Metropolitano\\nduring the\\n1946\\u201347 season\\nand in five matches of the\\n1947\\u201348 season\\n.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nDespite these inconveniences, Real Madrid maintained its sports activities while the new stadium took shape over part of the old site and on the adjacent lands.\\nThis is how Fernando de C\\u00e1rcer Disdier, the club's first vice president, summarized the development of the construction in 1947:\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nWe encountered numerous difficulties in transporting materials. Keep in mind that we used 18,000 m\\n2\\nof gravel, 24,000 m\\n2\\nof sand, 2,000,000 bricks, 900 m\\n2\\nof wood, and moved about 150,000 m\\n3\\nof earth. For this, we had to load 82,000 trucks of 4 tons each\\u2026 On average, 150 workers worked per day, so we had to pay about 315,000 workdays. For the services and sanitation network, we installed 4.5 kilometers of stoneware, iron, and lead pipes, with 90 porcelain sinks, 125 toilets, 365 urinals, and 46 showers. There is enough space to install offices, restaurants, warehouses, and other services, but for now, we have limited ourselves to the essentials for football: 4 dressing rooms for players with their corresponding showers, a swimming pool, a massage room, and a first aid kit. An infirmary with 6 beds, a treatment room, and an emergency operating room. A dressing room for the referee with all its services. A wardrobe room with a clothing repair workshop and iron. A shoemaker, laundry, and a large gymnasium. A telephone exchange and a radio amplification center\\u2026 Additionally, a room for detainees has been built, thus avoiding the need for law enforcement to be distracted by escorting them. Regarding the costs, around 16,000,000 pesetas were budgeted, but this has increased due to perfectly justified reasons, such as the nature of the terrain, the rise in material prices over these 30 months, more than 25% in some cases, and the new labor regulations in the construction industry that required safety measures not contemplated in the project. Currently (in 1947), if we were to start the construction of the stadium, its cost would rise to 45,000,000 pesetas. The amortization is planned to be completed in 20 years with our own resources, and without having started using the new field, we have already begun to amortize. This is a great success for Real Madrid and the people of Madrid\\n.\\n\\u2014\\nFernando de C\\u00e1rcer Disdier\\n.\\nThe total cost of the works, in round numbers, was broken down into the following items:\\n[\\n11\\n]\\nLand\\n. Acquisitions, capital gains, real rights, stamps, writing expenses, cancellation of commitments, and lifting of the mortgage on the old Chamart\\u00edn: 4,500,000 pesetas.\\nLoans\\n. Costs of the same: 2,000,000 pesetas.\\nWorks\\n. Material execution of the stadium: 28,000,000 pesetas. Execution of the office: 1,500,000 pesetas.\\nFees\\n.

Real Madrid striker\\nSabino Barinaga\\nscored the first goal in the 15th minute with a header. At the end of the match, Barinaga received a recognition pennant. Afterward, players and managers of both teams celebrated with a dinner. The first official match took place on 28 December 1947 on matchday 12 of La Liga against\\nAthletic Club\\n, which had been postponed due to the inauguration of the stadium. The match was refereed by Jos\\u00e9 Fombona Fern\\u00e1ndez from the Asturian school and ended with a 5\\u20131 victory for\\nLos Blancos\\n. The first goal was scored in the 4th minute by Madrid midfielder\\nChus Alonso\\nafter receiving a pass from Barinaga.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nThe stadium's official name at the time was\\nEstadio Real Madrid Club de F\\u00fatbol\\n, although it continued to be known among fans as\\nNuevo Estadio Chamart\\u00edn\\n(English:\\nNew Chamart\\u00edn Stadium\\n) or simply\\nChamart\\u00edn\\n. The stadium had an initial capacity of 75,145 spectators, 27,645 of which had seats (7,125 covered) and 47,500 for standing fans.\\n1950s\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe stadium in 1955\\nThe first major renovation occurred in 1955. On 19 June of that year, the stadium expanded to accommodate 125,000 spectators. Thus, the Madrid coliseum became the biggest stadium of all the participants of the newly established\\nEuropean Cup\\n.\\nOn 4 January 1955, after the General Assembly of Members Compromisaros, it was decided that the stadium adopt its present name in honour of club President Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIn March 1957,\\nfloodlights\\nwere installed to allow nighttime games. On 18 May of the same year, the new floodlights were officially inaugurated in a game against Brazilian club\\nSport Recife\\n, which Real Madrid won 5\\u20133.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\n1960s and 1970s\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn 1965, the transfer of all the club's offices to the stadium was completed, which previously had been moved between multiple venues in the capital.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nOn 14 December 1972, coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u's inauguration, the first electronic scoreboard was installed inside the stadium and later utilized for the first time in a friendly match against the same rival that Madrid faced in 1947, the Portuguese Belenenses. The match ended with a 2\\u20131 Real victory. Days before the scoreboard had already been used for the farewell ceremony of the Madrid legend\\nPaco Gento\\n.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\n1980s\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nThe next big changes did not occur until the early 1980s with the hosting of the\\n1982 FIFA World Cup\\nin Spain. The stadium had to adapt to the changing times and with this, architects Rafael Luis Alemany and Manuel Salinas were hired for the stadium's renovation project. The brothers were sons of Luis Alemany Soler, who carried out the original construction project next to Mu\\u00f1oz Monasterio. The work lasted 16 months and had a cost of 704\\u00a0million\\npesetas\\n(US $4.7\\u00a0million), of which 530\\u00a0million was paid by the City of Madrid.\\nThe improvements included a number of points. First,\\nFIFA\\nforced two-thirds of the seating area to be covered. For this reason, Real Madrid installed a roof covering the perimeter of the first and second tiers of seating, except the east side. The stadium's capacity was reduced from 120,000 to 90,000 spectators, starting downsizing in 1978. 24,550 of which were covered by the new roof. The project also involved remodeling the fa\\u00e7ade, the installation of new electronic signs in the north and south ends, as well as the renovation of the press areas, lockers rooms, access, and ancillary areas.\\nThe stadium hosted four matches in the World Cup: three second-round Group Two matches (\\nWest Germany\\nvs.\\nEngland\\n, West Germany vs.\\nSpain\\n, and Spain vs. England) and the prestigious\\nfinal match\\n(Italy vs. West Germany). The final between Italy and Germany was played in front of a sold out stadium of 90,000 people.\\n1990s\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nFollowing a series of spectator fatalities in the 1980s (most notably the\\nHeysel Stadium in Belgium\\nand the\\nHillsborough Stadium in England\\n), English authorities released the\\nTaylor Report\\non how to improve football spectator safety in English venues.\\nUEFA\\nfollowed suit across Europe. The stadium was forced to create separate shortcuts to different stadium sections and seats for all spectators.\\nIn 1992, the board of\\nRam\\u00f3n Mendoza\\nawarded an expansion and renovation project to Gines Navarro Construcciones, S.A. The work started on 7 February 1992 and concluded on 7 May 1994 with a final cost of more than 5\\u00a0billion pesetas, substantially raising the debt of the club, which no longer had any institutional support. The work concluded with the creation of an amphitheater on the west side and in the foundations, as well as the opening of the new commercial center, \\\"La esquina del Bernab\\u00e9u\\\". In total, 20,200 upgraded seats were installed, with each seat having a tilt of 87 degrees, ensuring a perfect view and proximity to the pitch. In addition, four entrance towers were erected on the outside, each with two staircases and a central spiral ramp, so the spectators could access the new tier and exit more quickly.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nWith the new structure, the height of the stadium was increased from 22\\u00a0m to 45\\u00a0m. This caused problems during the winter, leaving two-thirds of the field of play in the shade. This lack of sunlight led to grass deterioration on the pitch. For this reason, a polypropylene pipe network was installed at a 20\\u00a0cm depth under the pitch. At over 30\\u00a0km long the pipe system circulates hot water, keeping the turf from freezing in cold temperatures.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nAlso, due to the height of the stand, it was necessary to improve and increase the lighting capability. A\\nretractable protective roof\\nwas also installed to protect the fans from the elements. After the renovation, the stadium's capacity was 106,000 spectators.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nIn 1997, with\\nLorenzo Sanz\\nas president, UEFA required the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u to adopt an all-seating arrangement, bringing its capacity down from 106,000 to 74,328 spectators.\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nOn 20 May 1999, the Tour Bernab\\u00e9u opened, along with the club museum.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n2000s\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nView of the stadium during the\\nMadrid derby\\nin the\\n2006\\u201307 La Liga\\n2010 UEFA Champions League final\\nopening ceremony\\nAs the club kept growing in all regards, thoughts for further changes to the stadium appeared.\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nWhen\\nFlorentino P\\u00e9rez\\nbecame the president of the club, he launched a \\\"\\nMaster Plan\\n\\\" with one goal: to improve the comfort of the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u and the quality of its facilities, and maximise revenue for the stadium.\\nP\\u00e9rez invested\\n\\u20ac\\n127\\u00a0million in five years (2001\\u20132006) by adding an expansion to the east side of the stadium, as well as adding a new fa\\u00e7ade on Father Damien street, new boxes and VIP areas, new dressing rooms, a new stage in honour of the east side, a new press area (also located on the east side), a new audio system, new bars, integration of heating in the stands, panoramic lifts, new restaurants, escalators in the tower access, and implementation of the multipurpose building in Father Damien street. Following the enlargement of the lateral east side and the creation of new galleries, the capacity of the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u was expanded to 80,354, all seated.\\nAfter these renovations, on 14 November 2007, one month before the 60th anniversary of the stadium's opening, UEFA awarded the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u the category of\\nElite Stadium\\nand designated it as the venue for the\\n2010 UEFA Champions League final\\n.\\n[\\n29\\n]\\n2010s\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nIn the summer of 2011, expansion work was carried out in the first amphitheater, adding an additional row to the overhang of the grandstand, which increased the capacity by 900 seats, reaching a total capacity of 81,044 spectators.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nIn December 2018, the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u Stadium was selected as the venue for the second leg of the Copa Libertadores de Am\\u00e9rica final, becoming the first stadium in the world to host the final of four of the five most important tournaments in the world: the\\nFIFA World Cup\\n, the\\nUEFA European Championship\\n, the\\nCopa Am\\u00e9rica\\n, the\\nCopa Libertadores de Am\\u00e9rica\\n, and the\\nUEFA Champions League\\n.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nRenovation 2019\\u20132024\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nAfter investing a total of 256 million euros since 2000,\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nthe Board of Directors, led by\\nFlorentino P\\u00e9rez\\n, decided to take advantage of the stadium's prime location to launch an ambitious renovation project with a dual objective: to transform the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u into a global icon of sport architecture and to make it one of the club's main sources of direct revenue, allowing it to continue competing economically with clubs owned by large private capital in the future.\\nThis proposal was announced at the Ordinary General Assembly on 12 September 2010,\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nand approved by the delegate members at the Extraordinary Assembly on 25 September 2011.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\nTo implement it, the\\nMadrid City Council\\nand the\\nGovernment of the Community of Madrid\\napproved a specific amendment to the General Urban Development Plan in 2012, allowing the club to increase the buildability of the stadium and modify its facade. The proposed plan included a new architectural envelope, roof covering for all seats, and the incorporation of bioclimatic systems with renewable energy, as well as the construction of two new public plazas, a hotel, and a large shopping centre on the side facing Paseo de la Castellana.\\nTo carry out this proposal, an International Architecture Competition was held in 2012\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nin which four teams of world-renowned prestige participated: one formed by the studios of\\nHerzog & de Meuron\\nand\\nRafael Moneo\\n; another composed of\\nFoster and Partners\\nand\\nRafael de la Hoz\\n; a third consisting of the teams of\\nPopulous\\nand\\nEstudio Lamela\\n; and a fourth formed by\\nGMP Architekten\\n, L35, and Ribas & Ribas, whose proposal was announced as the winning project on 31 January 2014.\\n[\\n37\\n]\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nHowever, the project was halted in February 2015,\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nwhen the Superior Court of Justice of Madrid annulled the approval of the specific amendment to the General Urban Development Plan of Madrid, considering it contrary to the general interest and urban planning regulations. The court argued that the plan entailed a substantial alteration of land use and an unjustified free grant of urban development rights to Real Madrid. Faced with this situation, the club decided to modify the winning project to comply with current laws and reduce its urban impact. Thus, in 2016,\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nit presented a new project that eliminated the hotel and shopping center, raised the height of the stadium by only 12 meters (39\\u00a0ft) for the construction of the roof, reaching a total height of 60 meters (200\\u00a0ft), and eliminated the possibility of increasing the capacity.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nFinally, on 31 May 2017, the Madrid City Council approved the renovation by approving the \\\"Special Plan for the Santiago Bernab\\u00e9u Stadium\\\".\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nAfter approving the replotting project, the sustainable mobility plan, and the urbanization project, the club awarded the renovation works to the construction company\\nFCC Construcciones\\n, which finally began in June 2019.\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nThe retractable roof and inside of the stadium in 2024.\\nFor the financing of the works,\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nthe Real Madrid Board of Directors approved a loan of 575 million euros on 12 April 2019, for 30 years with a fixed interest rate of 2.5%, including a 3-year grace period, resulting in an annual payment of 29.5 million euros starting from 30 July 2023. Additionally, on 7 December 2021, the financing was extended with an additional loan of 225 million euros for 27 years with a fixed interest rate of 1.53% and a grace period until 30 July 2024, with an annual payment of 10.5 million euros starting from that date. Finally, on 11 November 2023, a third loan\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nof 370 million euros for 30 years was requested to cover cost overruns due to the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic\\nand the\\nRussian invasion of Ukraine\\n. Thus, the total financing amounts to 1.170 billion euros at an average interest rate of 3%, with an annual payment of 60 million euros over 30 years, which is less than half of the new expected annual profits after the completion of the works.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nLocation\\n[\\nedit\\n]\\nConstruction of the East side facade (4 April 2023).\\nThe stadium is located in the\\nChamart\\u00edn\\ndistrict of Madrid.
