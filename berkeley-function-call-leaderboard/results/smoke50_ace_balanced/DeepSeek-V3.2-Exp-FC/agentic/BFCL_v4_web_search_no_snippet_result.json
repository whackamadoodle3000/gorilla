She not only provides clear direction and leadership, she also critiques extremely effectively. That she is a meticulous Creative Director who understands the importance of a clear brand strategy is evidenced by the work we've put out together. She brings a calm attitude to a hectic project list, never losing her cool and always meeting deadlines and exceeding expectations. She brings imagination and innovation to every project and couples her creative talent with a business mind, which is a combination that can be hard to find. All in all, she\\u2019s one of the best managers and people I\\u2019ve worked with and I look forward to continuing our professional relationship for many years to come.\\u201d\\nTess Forte\\n\\u201cI have worked with many, many Creative Directors over the years, and Courtney is hands-down the absolute best. She oversees and has a hand in so much in her day to day-- from managing a large Creative Studio team to dealing directly with clients to liaising with top Time Inc executives. Not only is she the most calm and collected manager I've ever seen, she has the most extraordinary way of managing expectations within the Real Simple team and with clients, communicating what is \\\"realistic\\\" while ensuring that everyone feels they are being heard and their best interests will be met. She is an amazing manager-- always there for her team of designers and freelancers, but giving everyone ample freedom to \\\"do their own thing\\\" and really shine.

She brings a calm attitude to a hectic project list, never losing her cool and always meeting deadlines and exceeding expectations. She brings imagination and innovation to every project and couples her creative talent with a business mind, which is a combination that can be hard to find.

Not only is she the most calm and collected manager I\\'ve ever seen, she has the most extraordinary way of managing expectations within the Real Simple team and with clients, communicating what is \\\\\"realistic\\\\\" while ensuring that everyone feels they are being heard and their best interests will be met. She is an amazing manager-- always there for her team of designers and freelancers, but giving everyone ample freedom to \\\\\"do their own thing\\\\\" and really shine.

She not only provides clear direction and leadership, she also critiques extremely effectively. That she is a meticulous Creative Director who understands the importance of a clear brand strategy is evidenced by the work we\\'ve put out together. She brings a calm attitude to a hectic project list, never losing her cool and always meeting deadlines and exceeding expectations. She brings imagination and innovation to every project and couples her creative talent with a business mind, which is a combination that can be hard to find. All in all, she\\\\u2019s one of the best managers and people I\\\\u2019ve worked with and I look forward to continuing our professional relationship for many years to come.\\\\u201d\\\\nTess Forte\\\\n\\\\u201cI have worked with many, many Creative Directors over the years, and Courtney is hands-down the absolute best. She oversees and has a hand in so much in her day to day-- from managing a large Creative Studio team to dealing directly with clients to liaising with top Time Inc executives. Not only is she the most calm and collected manager I\\'ve ever seen, she has the most extraordinary way of managing expectations within the Real Simple team and with clients, communicating what is \\\\\"realistic\\\\\" while ensuring that everyone feels they are being heard and their best interests will be met. She is an amazing manager-- always there for her team of designers and freelancers, but giving everyone ample freedom to \\\\\"do their own thing\\\\\" and really shine.

She not only provides clear direction and leadership, she also critiques extremely effectively. That she is a meticulous Creative Director who understands the importance of a clear brand strategy is evidenced by the work we\\'ve put out together. She brings a calm attitude to a hectic project list, never losing her cool and always meeting deadlines and exceeding expectations. She brings imagination and innovation to every project and couples her creative talent with a business mind, which is a combination that can be hard to find. All in all, she\\\\u2019s one of the best managers and people I\\\\u2019ve worked with and I look forward to continuing our professional relationship for many years to come.\\\\u201d\\\\nTess Forte\\\\n\\\\u201cI have worked with many, many Creative Directors over the years, and Courtney is hands-down the absolute best. She oversees and has a hand in so much in her day to day-- from managing a large Creative Studio team to dealing directly with clients to liaising with top Time Inc executives. Not only is she the most calm and collected manager I\\'ve ever seen, she has the most extraordinary way of managing expectations within the Real Simple team and with clients, communicating what is \\\\\"realistic\\\\\" while ensuring that everyone feels they are being heard and their best interests will be met. She is an amazing manager-- always there for her team of designers and freelancers, but giving everyone ample freedom to \\\\\"do their own thing\\\\\" and really shine. I feel so lucky to know and learn from her!\\\\u201d\\\\n5 people have recommended Courtney\\\\nJoin now to view\\\\nMore activity by Courtney\\\\nFrom a white-space vision to a full-blown movement, team NOYZ has redefined what storytelling in beauty looks, feels and smells like.\\\\n\\\\nFor every\\\\u2026\\\\nFrom a white-space vision to a full-blown movement, team NOYZ has redefined what storytelling in beauty looks, feels and smells like.\\\\n\\\\nFor every\\\\u2026\\\\nLiked by\\\\nCourtney Brown Warren\\\\nAndre 3000 referenced Jack White\\'s \\\\\"Little Rooms\\\\\" at the Rock Hall Inductions last weekend in LA.\\\\n\\\\nThe thesis: all big things start small.
