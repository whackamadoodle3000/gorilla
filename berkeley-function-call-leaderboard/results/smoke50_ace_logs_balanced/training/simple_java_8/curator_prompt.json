Generally respect the BFCL evaluation but think about what you would want to tell the model in order for it to improve in the many cases it may face in the future.keep the playbook unchanged on successes unless an existing entry now conflicts with verified behaviour.

Failed to decode AST. 'str' object has no attribute 'keys'\n\nTool-call differences:\nTurn 0: missing EFSNIOFile.setContents; extra I can help you update the file contents using the EFSNIOFile_setContents function. Based on your requirements, I have all the necessary parameters:\n\n- `source`: `fileStream`\n\nEvaluation details (JSON):\n{\n  \"status\": \"evaluated\",\n  \"valid\": false,\n  \"details\": {\n    \"id\": \"simple_java_8\",\n    \"model_name\": \"DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp-FC\",\n    \"test_category\": \"simple_java\",\n    \"valid\": false,\n    \"error\": [\n      \"Invalid syntax.

The function expects the InputStream parameter to be provided as a string representation of the Java object. Could you please specify how you'd like me to represent the `fileStream` object? For example, should I use the object's variable name directly, or do you have a specific string representation format in mind?\\n\\nOnce you provide this clarification, I'll be able to execute the file update operation for you.\"\n}\n\nGround truth reference:\nFocus on achieving the checker-validated tool effects.\n\nReflection:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The model failed to make any actual tool call, instead providing explanatory text about what it would do with EFSNIOFile_setContents function.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"Missing required EFSNIOFile.setContents tool call while generating explanatory text about parameters.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"The model treated the scenario as a conversational clarification request rather than executing the expected file update operation.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"Should have directly invoked EFSNIOFile.setContents with the specified parameters (source=fileStream, force=true, keepHistory=false, monitor=progressMonitor) without seeking additional clarification.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When all required parameters are clearly specified in the user request, the model should execute the tool call directly rather than requesting unnecessary clarifications.\"\n}\n\nGuidance:\n- If the evaluation PASSED, many cases you would return an empty operation list.

Return an empty list when no update is needed.\n\nReturn JSON with keys \"reasoning\" (<=2 sentences) and \"operations\".\nEach operation must be one of:\n  {\"type\": \"ADD\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"content\": \"<short bullet>\"}\n  {\"type\": \"MODIFY\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"ID\": \"<existing id>\", \"content\": \"<short bullet>\"}\n  {\"type\": \"REMOVE\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"ID\": \"<existing id>\"}"
