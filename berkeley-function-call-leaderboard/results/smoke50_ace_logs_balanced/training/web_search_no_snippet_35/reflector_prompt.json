Use the evaluation summary and outcome to focus on genuine divergences. When the evaluation passed, highlight the key behaviour that matched expectations or note that no corrective insight is needed. BFCL evaluates whether tool calls, parameters, and state transitions are correct; the model does not need to mirror the ground-truth text verbatim. Respond in compact JSON."
