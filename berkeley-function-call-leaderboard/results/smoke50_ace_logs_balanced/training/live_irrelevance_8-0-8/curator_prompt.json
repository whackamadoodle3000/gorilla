Generally respect the BFCL evaluation but think about what you would want to tell the model in order for it to improve in the many cases it may face in the future.keep the playbook unchanged on successes unless an existing entry now conflicts with verified behaviour. Functional parity with the checker matters more than superficial differences . Output JSON."

Unfortunately, I don't currently have access to the specific API tools needed to retrieve company data from IP addresses.\\n\\nFor this type of functionality, you might want to consider:\\n\\n- **IP geolocation services** like IPinfo, MaxMind, or IP2Location that provide company/organization data\\n- **Business intelligence APIs** that can correlate IP addresses with company information\\n- **Custom solutions** that combine IP geolocation with business directory APIs\\n\\nThese services typically require API keys and may have usage limits or subscription fees. Many offer free tiers for limited usage, which could be a good starting point for testing.\\n\\nWould you like me to help you with any other type of API integration or data retrieval that I can currently assist with using my available tools?\"\n}\n\nGround truth reference:\nFocus on achieving the checker-validated tool effects.\n\nReflection:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The evaluation passed because the model correctly identified it lacked appropriate tools for the IP-to-company API request, matching the expected behavior for this irrelevance scenario.\",\n  \"error_identification\": \"No errors detected - the model properly recognized tool limitations and declined to make inappropriate tool calls.\",\n  \"root_cause_analysis\": \"This was a live_irrelevance test case where the model needed to identify that available tools couldn't fulfill the user's specific request.\",\n  \"correct_approach\": \"The model appropriately acknowledged its limitations and suggested alternative solutions without attempting invalid tool usage.\",\n  \"key_insight\": \"When tools are irrelevant to a request, clear acknowledgment of limitations with helpful alternatives demonstrates proper tool awareness.\"\n}\n\nGuidance:\n- If the evaluation PASSED, many cases you would return an empty operation list.

Return an empty list when no update is needed.\n\nReturn JSON with keys \"reasoning\" (<=2 sentences) and \"operations\".\nEach operation must be one of:\n  {\"type\": \"ADD\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"content\": \"<short bullet>\"}\n  {\"type\": \"MODIFY\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"ID\": \"<existing id>\", \"content\": \"<short bullet>\"}\n  {\"type\": \"REMOVE\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"ID\": \"<existing id>\"}"
