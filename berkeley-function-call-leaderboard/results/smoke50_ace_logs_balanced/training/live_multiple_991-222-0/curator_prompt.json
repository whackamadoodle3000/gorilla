Only generalize when the evaluation summary indicates a systemic issue, but otherwise don't overgeneralize bullet points. Generally respect the BFCL evaluation but think about what you would want to tell the model in order for it to improve in the many cases it may face in the future.keep the playbook unchanged on successes unless an existing entry now conflicts with verified behaviour. Functional parity with the checker matters more than superficial differences . Output JSON."

Propose removals or updates when the current playbook conflicts with the verified behaviour as to need to be updated.\n- If the evaluation FAILED, add, modify, or remove bullets narrowly targeted to the failure described in the summary/details.\n- Keep updates scoped to the triggering context unless the pattern is clearly systemic.\n- Keep content under 160 characters. Return an empty list when no update is needed.\n\nReturn JSON with keys \"reasoning\" (<=2 sentences) and \"operations\".\nEach operation must be one of:\n  {\"type\": \"ADD\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"content\": \"<short bullet>\"}\n  {\"type\": \"MODIFY\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"ID\": \"<existing id>\", \"content\": \"<short bullet>\"}\n  {\"type\": \"REMOVE\", \"section\": \"<tool_group>\", \"ID\": \"<existing id>\"}"
